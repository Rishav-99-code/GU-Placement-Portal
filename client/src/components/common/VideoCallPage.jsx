        // ðŸ”¥ IMPORTANT REFINEMENT: More robust initiator logic.
        // The first person in the room (the initiator) will create the offer.
        // We need to check if we are the only one in the room when this function runs.
        // This usually happens when the "user-joined" event means *we* are the second person,
        // or when we are the first person and the other user hasn't joined yet.
        // The backend `user-joined` event will trigger `startMediaAndPeerConnection` for the *second* user.
        // The first user should ideally wait for the 'user-joined' event before making an offer,
        // or have a more explicit "call initiated" signal.
        // For simplicity, let's assume the first person to join the room eventually triggers this.
        // A more correct way for 2-person calls: the person who triggers 'user-joined' (the 2nd person)
        // waits for an offer, while the *initiator* (1st person) creates it *after* the other joins.

        // Given your backend's `user-joined` sends to the *second* user,
        // the first user needs a way to know the second user has joined.
        // The `user-joined` event is only emitted to others in the room.
        // So, the initiator should await a signal from the server that the second user is ready.

        // A simple way to determine the initiator without server state for 2-person call:
        // The person who *receives* the `user-joined` message is *not* the initiator.
        // The person who *emits* `join-call` and receives `user-joined` for *another* user is the initiator.
        // Let's assume the first person initiates the offer upon receiving 'user-joined' (meaning someone else joined)
        // OR, if they are the FIRST to join, they wait.

        // For a basic 2-person setup, where the first person in the room should initiate the offer
        // AFTER the second person has joined (and this `startMediaAndPeerConnection` is called on both):
        // We need to ensure the offer is only created once.
        // This is a common point of complexity in WebRTC.
        // Let's use `socket.current.id` as a simple unique identifier.
        // If you are the person who initiated the call (e.g. clicked the call button),
        // you would typically generate the offer. This info isn't directly in this component.
        // For now, let's simplify based on which user is 'first' to get their media ready.
        // The current `if (socket.current.id === authState.user.id)` is very simplistic and not reliable for initiator.

        // A more robust but still simple initiator logic for 2-person calls:
        // The user whose `socket.id` is lexicographically smaller initiates the offer.
        // Or, more commonly, the user who sends the `initiate-call` event to the backend is the offerer.
        // As we don't have that `initiate-call` logic here, let's stick to a reliable signaling flow:
        // The "join-call" triggers "user-joined" for the *other* peer.
        // The peer who receives "user-joined" should then consider creating an offer if they are the primary.
        // For this example, let's assume the client whose `socket.id` is smaller in the room initiates.
        // This is still not robust without knowing the other socket ID at this point.

        // REVISED INITIATOR LOGIC: The `user-joined` event on the backend is emitted to the *existing* clients in the room
        // when a new client joins. This means the client *receiving* `user-joined` should be the offerer.
        // The client *emitting* `user-joined` (the newly joined client) should wait for an offer.
        // This flow is more typical for WebRTC.

        // So, when `user-joined` is received by the *first* participant (who is waiting), they should create the offer.
        // The `startMediaAndPeerConnection` function is called for *both* participants.
        // The `user-joined` event itself is the trigger for the first client to *start* their PC and create offer.
        // The second client just joins and waits for the offer.

        // Let's adjust the logic to reflect this common WebRTC handshake:
        // The "join-call" for the FIRST person simply prepares.
        // The "join-call" for the SECOND person triggers "user-joined" on the server
        // which sends it to the FIRST person. The FIRST person then makes the offer.
